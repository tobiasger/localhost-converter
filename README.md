# localhost-converter
![localhost-converter](http://www.tobiasgerhardsson.com/localhost_converter.jpg)
Simple desktop app (made with Electron) for converting localhost adresses to shareable adresses in local network.
##Why?
This is a project for me to learn some [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io), JavaScript and the basics of handling a GitHub repository. The app might be very unnecessary.
